Kaggle Challenge: Predicting Taxi Service Trajectory

We build a predictive framework based on simple Machine Learning algorithms to infer the final destination of taxi rides in Porto. A dataset is given in the Kaggle challenge website with the title ”ECML/PKDD 15: Taxi Trajectory Prediction (I)”. 

The challenge is to predict as accurately as possible the final destination of a taxi given a partial initial trajectory of its path. 
This task consists of predicting the destination of a taxi based on the beginning of its trajectory, represented as a variable-length sequence of GPS points and other associated information, such as departure time and client and taxi information. 

I used an automated approach based on feed-forward neural network to estimate the final destination given in GPS coordinates, which was then compared to basic linear models.

As there was a strict time constraint in implementing a solution, I implemented this in Matlab.
Will soon upload a Python Version.

More details to be followed...
